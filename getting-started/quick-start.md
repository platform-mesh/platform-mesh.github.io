## Quick Start

::: warning Development Preview
This local setup is under active development and intended for evaluation and development purposes only. The local environment differs from production deployments in architecture, security configuration, and scalability.

Track progress and upcoming improvements on our [project dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/platform-mesh/projects/7).
:::

### 1. Download the Release

Clone the 0.1.0 release
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch 0.1.0 https://github.com/platform-mesh/helm-charts.git
cd helm-charts/local-setup
```

### 2. Configure Local DNS

Before running the setup script, add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 portal.dev.local kcp.api.portal.dev.local
```

::: tip WSL Users
Also add these entries to the Windows hosts file at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
:::

The setup script will verify these entries are properly configured and provide platform-specific guidance if they're missing.

::: warning Organization Subdomains
Each created organization gets its own subdomain (e.g., `<organization-name>.portal.dev.local`) that must be added to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 <organization-name>.portal.dev.local
```

Remember to add a hosts entry for every organization you create in the platform.
:::

### 3. Run the Setup

The setup script automates the entire bootstrap process. Choose one of the following options:

#### Standard Setup

::: code-group

```bash [Task]
# Full setup (deletes existing cluster and creates new one)
task local-setup

# Iterate on existing cluster (faster, preserves cluster state)
task local-setup:iterate
```

```bash [Script]
# Full setup (deletes existing cluster and creates new one)
kind delete cluster --name platform-mesh
./scripts/start.sh

# Iterate on existing cluster (faster, preserves cluster state)
./scripts/start.sh
```

:::

After the script is finished, it should print `Installation Complete ♥ !` along with instructions on accessing the portal.

#### Cached Setup (Faster)

Image caching speeds up cluster recreation by using local Docker registry mirrors. The setup script automatically starts the required registry proxies when using cached mode.

::: code-group

```bash [Task]
# Full setup with caching
task local-setup:cached

# Iterate on existing cluster
task local-setup:cached:iterate
```

```bash [Script]
# Full setup with caching
kind delete cluster --name platform-mesh
./scripts/start.sh --cached

# Iterate on existing cluster
./scripts/start.sh --cached
```

:::

::: info Setup Duration
The initial setup typically takes 5-10 minutes, depending on your internet connection and machine performance.
:::

### 4. Access the Services

Once the setup is complete, you can access:

- **Onboarding Portal**: `https://portal.dev.local:8443`
- **KCP API**: `https://kcp.api.portal.dev.local:8443`

::: warning Certificate Trust
You may need to trust the local certificates generated by mkcert. The setup script will attempt to do this automatically, but you may need to manually trust them in your browser or system keychain.

For detailed certificate trust instructions for different platforms (WSL2, Windows, Linux), see the [troubleshooting section](#certificate-trust-issues) below.
:::

## What's Installed?

The local setup deploys the following components:

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: containers
  - `kindest/node:v1.34.0` for KIND
  - 3 `registry:2` images if the cached task was used
- **Flux**: GitOps toolkit for continuous delivery
- **KRO**: Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator
- **OCM Controller**: Open Cluster Management controller

### Platform Mesh

The **Platform Mesh Operator** is the core component that deploys and manages all Platform Mesh infrastructure. The complete list of components for a given version is defined in the OCM (Open Component Model) component descriptor.

You can view the Platform Mesh components using:

```bash
ocm get componentversions --repo ghcr.io/platform-mesh github.com/platform-mesh/platform-mesh --latest -oyaml
```

::: details Installing the OCM CLI
If you don't have the OCM CLI installed, you can install it using one of the following methods:

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install open-component-model/tap/ocm
```

**Linux/macOS (Script):**
```bash
curl -s https://ocm.software/install.sh | bash
```

**Manual Installation:**
Download the binary for your platform from the [OCM releases page](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/releases).

For more installation options and details, see the [OCM installation documentation](https://ocm.software/docs/getting-started/installation/).
:::

Key components deployed by the operator include:

- **Portal**: A example implementation of a Portal UI based on Platform Mesh
- **Kubernetes GraphQL Gateway**: Generic Grahqpl Gateway that offers a Graphql api for the underlying KCP Control Plane
- **KCP**: Manages Kubernetes-based control planes
- **OpenFGA**: Central Relationship based Authorization system 
- **Keycloak**: Default Identity Provider used for authentication
- **Account Controller**: Handles multi-tenancy and management of accounts and organization
- **Extension Controller**: Handles Micro Frontend configurations and validations

::: details Example Component Structure (YAML)
```yaml
component:
  name: github.com/platform-mesh/platform-mesh
  version: <version>
  provider:
    name: platform-mesh
  resources:
    - componentName: github.com/platform-mesh/account-operator

    - componentName: github.com/gardener/etcd-druid
      name: etcd-druid
      version: <version>
    - componentName: github.com/platform-mesh/extension-manager-operator

    # ... additional components
```

## How It Works

The setup script automates the entire bootstrap process:

1. **Environment Validation** - Checks for required dependencies, system compatibility, hosts entries, and KCP kubectl plugin (when using `--example-data`)
2. **Cluster Creation** - Creates a Kind cluster with the necessary configuration
3. **Certificate Setup** - Generates local SSL certificates for secure access
4. **Platform Mesh Prerequisites** - Installs Flux, KRO, and OCM
5. **Platform Mesh Installation** - Deploys the Platform Mesh operator and components
6. **Post-Install Configuration** - Creates KCP kubeconfig and validates readiness

The Platform Mesh operator manages the actual component deployment by reconciling the `PlatformMesh` custom resource. For detailed information about the bootstrap process and operator API, see:
