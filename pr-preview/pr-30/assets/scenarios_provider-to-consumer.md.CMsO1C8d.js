This is a common scenario for <strong>Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)</strong>, where multiple teams are consuming services. In this case, the provider is maintaining their own Kubernetes cluster, where all business logic is running, and exposing the service APIs using <strong>api-syncagent</strong>. The 1:n consumers are using <strong>kcp</strong> concepts of <code>APIExport</code> and <code>APIBinding</code> to declaratively consume the services in their own control-planes.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="P2C Kube to Mesh Diagram"></p><p>Here the provider is exposing only the necessary APIs using <code>APIExport</code> and <code>api-syncagent</code> machinery to manage API object remapping, and the consumer can declaratively consume service instances using <code>APIBinding</code>.

Each team manages their own cluster(s) and uses <code>APIBinding</code> to consume services declaratively. And because the <strong>Analytics Team</strong> constructs their own services inside their own Kubernetes cluster, they need a declarative way to consume services from the <strong>Database Team</strong>. For this they are using <code>Kube-bind</code> to establish the relationship between platform mesh and their own cluster for <strong>Database Team</strong> services. This way the source of truth for the services is the Analytics Team&#39;s consumer cluster.</p><h2 id="kube-provider-to-platform-mesh-consumer-to-kube-consumer" tabindex="-1">Kube (provider) to platform-mesh (consumer) to Kube (consumer) <a class="header-anchor" href="#kube-provider-to-platform-mesh-consumer-to-kube-consumer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kube (provider) to platform-mesh (consumer) to Kube (consumer)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The nature of Kubernetes is declarative, and the above scenario works well for many use-cases. But it has a challenge. In most cases, consumers want to be able to declare services close to where the workloads are running. In this case, similar to the first scenario, they extend their platform-mesh control-plane to their own clusters. For this, <strong>kube-bind</strong> can be used between the consumer-owned <strong>platform-mesh</strong> and their own clusters.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="P2C Kube to Mesh Diagram"></p><hr><h2 id="how-this-fits-into-platform-mesh" tabindex="-1">How This Fits Into Platform Mesh <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-this-fits-into-platform-mesh" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How This Fits Into Platform Mesh&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The above flows illustrate how <strong>Provider to Consumer</strong> interactions are standardized in the Platform Mesh:</p><ul><li><strong>Providers</strong> expose declarative APIs using <a href="./../overview/control-planes.html"><strong>APIExports</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Consumers</strong> bind to those APIs using <strong>APIBindings</strong>, gaining seamless access through the <a href="./../overview/account-model.html"><strong>Account Model</strong></a>.</li><li><a href="./../overview/control-planes.html"><strong>Control planes</strong></a> reconcile declarative manifests into real-world capabilities.</li><li><strong>Operators and orchestration tools</strong> (kube-bind, KRO, multicluster-runtime) implement automation across boundaries.</li></ul><p>This creates a secure, flexible, and decoupled ecosystem where services can be:</p><ul><li>Exposed minimally.</li><li>Discovered and consumed declaratively.</li><li>Composed across organizational or cluster boundaries.</li><li>Governed through the <a href="./../overview/account-model.html"><strong>Account Model</strong></a> and <a href="./../overview/design-decision.html"><strong>Managed Service Provider pattern</strong></a>.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, Platform Mesh provides the <strong>P2C fabric</strong> for multi-team, multi-cluster, and multi-organization service interactions.</p>',34)])])}const _=o(u,[["render",h]]);export{P as __pageData,_ as default};
