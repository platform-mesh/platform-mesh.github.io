This is a common scenario for <strong>Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)</strong>, where multiple teams are consuming services. In this case, the provider is maintaining their own Kubernetes cluster, where all business logic is running, and exposing the service APIs using <strong>api-syncagent</strong>. The 1:n consumers are using <strong>kcp</strong> concepts of <code>APIExport</code> and <code>APIBinding</code> to declaratively consume the services in their own control-planes.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="P2C Kube to Mesh Diagram"></p><p>Here the provider is exposing only the necessary APIs using <code>APIExport</code> and <code>api-syncagent</code> machinery to manage API object remapping, and the consumer can declaratively consume service instances using <code>APIBinding</code>.

Each team manages their own cluster(s) and uses <code>APIBinding</code> to consume services declaratively. And because the <strong>Analytics Team</strong> constructs their own services inside their own Kubernetes cluster, they need a declarative way to consume services from the <strong>Database Team</strong>. For this they are using <code>Kube-bind</code> to establish the relationship between platform mesh and their own cluster for <strong>Database Team</strong> services. This way the source of truth for the services is the Analytics Team&#39;s consumer cluster.</p><h2 id="kube-provider-to-platform-mesh-consumer-to-kube-consumer" tabindex="-1">Kube (provider) to Platform-Mesh (consumer) to Kube (consumer) <a class="header-anchor" href="#kube-provider-to-platform-mesh-consumer-to-kube-consumer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kube (provider) to Platform-Mesh (consumer) to Kube (consumer)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The nature of Kubernetes is declarative, and the above scenario works well for many use-cases. But it has a challenge. In most cases, consumers want to be able to declare services close to where the workloads are running. In this case, similar to the first scenario, they extend their Platform-Mesh control-plane to their own clusters. For this, <strong>kube-bind</strong> can be used between the consumer-owned <strong>Platform-Mesh</strong> and their own clusters.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="P2C Kube to Mesh Diagram"></p><hr><h1 id="provider-to-provider-p2p" tabindex="-1">Provider to Provider (P2P) <a class="header-anchor" href="#provider-to-provider-p2p" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Provider to Provider (P2P)&quot;">​</a></h1><p>This section describes high-level scenarios of how cross-provider service exchange can be achieved using <strong>Platform Mesh</strong>.</p><h3 id="problem-description-1" tabindex="-1">Problem Description <a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-description-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problem Description&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In a direct <strong>provider to consumer</strong> setting, a provider wants to transfer technical information in a secure way to a consumer for a given service.
