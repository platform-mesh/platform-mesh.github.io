## Overview

The Account Model, powered by <Project>kcp</Project>, serves as the foundational fabric for managing interactions across a distributed cloud-edge continuum, enabling seamless collaboration between <Term>service providers</Term> and <Term>service consumers</Term> within the Platform Mesh architecture.
Built on <Project>kcp</Project>'s hierarchical organization concept and the <Term>Kubernetes Resource Model</Term>, it introduces a sophisticated structure where each account functions as an isolated <Term>control plane</Term>, transcending traditional approaches to service management.
Through its export and bind mechanisms, isolated environments, and multi-tenancy support, it creates an environment that elegantly handles the complexities of modern service ecosystems while ensuring clear organizational boundaries and precise operational control across diverse cloud and edge environments.

## Components

### Account Structure

At its core, the Platform Mesh implements a hierarchical account model that naturally mirrors how organizations operate.
This innovative approach provides isolated environments where companies can seamlessly map their business units, teams, and projects while maintaining clear ownership and access patterns.

    org[Organization]
    teamA[Team A]
    staging[Staging]
    prod[Production]
    dev[Development]
    teamB[Team B]
    qa[QA]

    org --> teamA
    teamA --> staging
    staging --> prod
    teamA --> dev
    org --> teamB
    teamB --> qa
```

The account structure offers several key capabilities:
- Deep nesting support that allows organizations to create structures matching their operational needs without artificial constraints
- Logical isolation ensuring secure multi-tenancy, where different roles like service consumers, providers, and marketplace functionality can operate independently
- Built-in support for defining different account types, each tailored to specific organizational needs
- Natural flow of policies and configurations through the hierarchy, simplifying governance
- Robust service integration mechanisms enabling providers to expose services and consumers to discover and utilize them within their isolated environments

This comprehensive set of features enables the implementation of governance models that align perfectly with specific requirements and compliance needs, while ensuring secure and scalable service management across the platform.


### Service Management Integration

The account model significantly enhances service interactions through automated relationship management between <Term>service consumers</Term> and <Term>service providers</Term>. When an organization engages with a provider, the platform automatically establishes necessary connections, creating dedicated shadow accounts and tenant spaces, ensuring secure and isolated service management while maintaining operational consistency.

Key aspects of Service Management Integration within the account model:
- **Automated Relationship Management:** The platform automates the establishment of connections between service consumers and providers. This includes creating dedicated shadow accounts and tenant spaces, streamlining the onboarding process and reducing manual configuration.
- **Declarative Service Consumption:** Leveraging the <Term>Kubernetes Resource Model</Term> (KRM), the platform enables declarative service consumption. Service consumers can define the desired state of their services through resources, and the platform ensures the actual state aligns with the desired state.
- **Managed Service Provider Pattern:** The integration leverages the Managed Service Provider pattern, where <Term>service providers</Term> are responsible for automating the lifecycle of <Term>capabilities</Term>. This pattern promotes scalability and regional distribution by enabling service providers to manage multiple <Term>service runtimes</Term> and deploy capabilities close to the consumer's application.
- **Service Catalog and Marketplace:** The platform facilitates a marketplace-like experience where service consumers can discover and select services offered by providers. This is enabled through export and bind mechanisms that allow providers to define service offerings and consumers to bind to these services.
- **Consumer Experience driven by KRM:** The consumer experience is driven by the Kubernetes Resource Model, providing a unified API surface for declarative service consumption across different providers. Consumers can interact with the platform through tools like `kubectl`, IaC, or GitOps approaches.

This integration expertly balances clear boundaries between different <Term>services</Term> with seamless integration across the service portfolio. It supports complex multi-tenant scenarios without compromising security and provides a foundation for a scalable and regionally distributed service ecosystem.

## Key Features

### Identity Management

Identity management within the account model delivers consistent authentication across the platform while preserving organizational control over user management.
Organizations can implement centralized identity strategies with sophisticated delegation capabilities.
The system seamlessly integrates with existing identity providers while upholding rigorous security standards and access controls,
enabling organizations to maintain their established identity practices while leveraging the platform's advanced security features.


### Service Orchestration

Service orchestration within the account model achieves new levels of efficiency by employing dedicated orchestration contexts that intelligently group related <Term>services</Term>. This sophisticated approach enables complex service compositions while preserving clear organizational boundaries. Unlike traditional orchestration, which relies on a central component to manage interactions, the Platform Mesh leverages a choreography-based approach, inspired by Kubernetes, for service orchestration.

Key aspects of Service Orchestration within the account model:
- **Choreography over Orchestration:** The platform adopts a choreography-based model for service orchestration, where services manage their functions autonomously, contributing to the overall system behavior without a central orchestrator. This decentralized approach enhances resilience and flexibility.
- **Decentralized Control:** In contrast to orchestration with a central control component, choreography distributes control among services. This reduces tight coupling and single points of failure, making the system more robust and adaptable to changes.
- **Emergent Behavior:** The desired system behavior emerges from the collaboration of individual services, each managed by its own controller with a reconciling control loop. This approach, similar to the "invisible hand" concept, allows for coordinated behavior without central command.
- **Dedicated Orchestration Contexts:** While leveraging choreography, the account model also introduces dedicated orchestration contexts. These contexts intelligently group related <Term>services</Term>, enabling complex service compositions while maintaining clear organizational boundaries. Services can be seamlessly grouped and managed regardless of their account location, supporting sophisticated cross-service scenarios.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Choreography allows for a loosely coupled architecture where services can be easily added, removed, or exchanged. This enhances the platform's flexibility and adaptability to evolving service ecosystems and changing requirements.

By employing a choreography-based approach with dedicated orchestration contexts, the account model achieves efficient service orchestration, enabling complex compositions and cross-service scenarios while maintaining resilience, flexibility, and clear organizational boundaries. The system accommodates both <Term>managed</Term> and <Term>unmanaged services</Term>, providing ultimate flexibility in service deployment and management approaches.
